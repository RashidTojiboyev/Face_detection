# Face_detection

## Haar feature-based cascade classifier:

Object Detection using the Haar-based cascad classifier is an effective object recognition method offered by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. This cascade function is a machine learning based approach that is trained from many positive and negative images. It is then used to define what is in the other images.

Here we work to identify the face. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images and negative images to teach the classifier. Then we need to get its features. To do this, the picture properties shown below are used. They are like our convective core. Each property is a single value obtained by collecting pixels under a white rectangle from a set of pixels under the black rectangle.
